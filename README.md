## Introduction

`sera` stops commands from running at the same time in clustered environment.

For example you might have two servers making an attempt to run the same task at the same moment, which can cause race
conditions. This can be prevented via a Message Queue (MQ) or centralised scheduling system, but sometimes you just want
a simpler solution.

`sera` will only lock commands with exactly the same arguments from running concurrently. For example `sera script.sh 10`
 and `sera script.sh 20` will not be blocked from running at the same time.

`sera` relies on the MySQL `get_lock()` function to ensure that only one instance in a cluster
is running a command at any time. Note however that `get_lock()` will not work in a Galera cluster or any 
other know Master / Master configuration.

## Usage

	sera <timeout-in-seconds> <command-to-run> < .. arguments and flags to command>

### timeout-in-seconds

Sera will wait <timeout-in-seconds> for a lock to be released. If there is no available lock within that time, sera will
abort running the <command-to-run>.
  
If you want the command to always be executed on every node, you set this value to the maximum time and some more for 
the command to be run on every node in the cluster. For example:

long-running-task.sh takes maximum 30 seconds to run on a node and you have 4 nodes in the cluster. Then you should call
set the <timeout-in-seconds> to more than 120. 

    sera 120 long-running-task.sh

If it doesn't matter which node runs the command, but it is still important that it they don't run at the same time, you
should set the  <timeout-in-seconds> to 0.
 
    sera 0 there-can-be-only-one.sh

### <command-to-run> & flags

The second and subsequent arguments is what command sera will execute. Sera will use the <command-to-run> and arguments
to that command as the name of the lock.
 
## Example

These two commands were started at roughly the same time, but only the one on the left got the lock first and the one to
the right timed out after 5 seconds.

## Configuration

Sera is looking for a configuration file located at  `/etc/sera.json`. It will fail if this lock file is not readable or
have the correct values.

	{
		"server": "sera:secret@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/?timeout=500ms",
		"syslog": true,
		"verbose": true
	}

**server**:  A Data Source Name string for connecting to a MySQL database, as described 
on (https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name)[https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name]

**syslog**: If sera should log errors and failed locking attempts to syslog

**verbose**: if sera should print log messages to stdout

## Installation:

Add the configuration file `/etc/sera.json` and either:

 - Download a binary from the (releases)[https://github.com/stojg/sera/releases]
 - Install via `go get github.com/silverstripe-labs/sera && go install github.com/silverstripe-labs/sera`

## Caveats

Be wary of normal bash syntax limitation. For example:
 
    sera 5 task.sh; echo "hello" 
    
will always execute `echo "hello"` due to the `;`

    sera 5 task.sh && dosomething.sh 
    
will only execute `dosomething.sh` if sera got a lock and task.sh succeeded.

    sera 5 task.sh || dosomething.sh
    
will only execute `dosomething.sh` if sera couldn't get a lock or if the task.sh returned a non zero exit 
code.

    sera 5 task.sh | wc 
    
will pipe the result of `task.sh` to wc
